It has been 10 months since the start of my URECA journey, and it has been an incredibly fruitful experience for me. 

Working with the Ageing Research Institute for Society and Education, I assisted the team in the development of a prototype to self-assess for multidimensional frailty, and it has been a truly invigorating experience to be able to apply my software development skills in the context of a real-life research project. The business requirements changed in tandem with progress in our research, and it is a novel experience to witness how changing business requirements can impact the way we develop, architect, and maintain software solutions. 

I learnt a lot in my 10 months on how one can develop a backend application, and the experience has sharpened my Java and Spring (a Java framework for backend development) skills and knowledge immensely. I am confident in applying my newfound knowledge in future internships and even after graduation as I prepare for a career in software engineering in the real world.

Most importantly, it is heartening to know that my craft will contribute toward the betterment of society and to the research efforts of ARISE, and I am thankful for all the learning and development I have garnered throughout this URECA journey.
